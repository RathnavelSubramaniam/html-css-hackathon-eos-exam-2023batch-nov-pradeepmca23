                           Is a shining example to show how one could rise from a humble beginning to the level of a chairman, presiding over an empire of educational institutions, by sheer hand hard work, dedication and devotion to a committed cause. Known for his magnanimity, spiritual bent of mind and suave cool demeanour, he is widely recognized and respected. To him, the panacea for the maladies of mankind lie in Education, Healthcare and farming.</p>
